# spagFSConcept
spagFS is a PoC implementation for the limited, but simple, spagFS

### Is there any specification?
There is no seperate specifications, as the specifications are currently given through the PoC implementation. If you implement it similiarly, it will work.

### Is there any future for this FS?
Absolutely not. I will probably abandone it within a few weeks lol. Also it has way too few features to be actually used.

### Hidden commands in test CLI
5 - Dumps Sector Information

### Where is the virtual disk saved?
The CLI currently doesn't save your data anywhere except your RAM, which is lost after closing the CLI.
